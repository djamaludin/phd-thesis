Summary
-------
Public key authentication is the verification of the identity-public key binding, and is foundational to the security of any network. The contribution of this thesis has been to provide public key authentication for a decentralised and resource challenged network such as an autonomous Delay Tolerant Network (DTN). It has resulted in the development and evaluation of a combined co-localisation trust system and key distribution scheme evaluated on a realistic large geographic scale mobility model. The thesis also addresses the problem of unplanned key revocation and replacement without any central authority.
